## 📌 Project Overview
The PC Parts Recommender System is a deep learning–powered tool that helps users:

🔍 **Find similar but cheaper components** (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, etc.)
🤝 **Get compatible part recommendations** to build balanced, high-performance PC setups
💡 **Build complete systems** with optimal component combinations

This project is developed by a team of students over 2 months as part of a practical ML/DL course.

## 🎯 Features
- **💰 Price & Performance Recommendations**: Find cheaper alternatives with similar specifications
- **🔧 Compatibility Recommendations**: Get parts that work well together
- **📊 Smart Similarity Matching**: Uses cosine similarity on deep learning embeddings
- **🎨 Modern UI**: Futuristic design with interactive cards and real-time updates

## 👥 Team Members
| Name | Role |
|------|------|
| 👨‍💻 Dhahbi Mohamed | Team Lead, Data Scientist (learner) |
| 👨‍💻 Bouthayna Hamdi | ML Engineer (learner) |
| 👩‍💻 Sami Abdelhafidh | UI/UX Designer, Back-end Dev |

> **Important Team Note**: ⚠️ Even though each member has specific tasks, our main objective is that everyone learns AI and understands every stage of the project.

🗓️ **Weekly Process**:
- Review progress in each area (scraping, cleaning, modeling, etc.)
- Explain work simply so everyone understands
- Ensure all members can follow the full pipeline from start to finish

💡 This transforms the project from divided work into a shared learning experience for the whole team 🚀

Tasks are managed using Notion, development happens in Google Colab, and version control with GitHub.
