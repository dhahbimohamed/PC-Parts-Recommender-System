# 🧠💻 PC Parts Recommender System  
**A Deep Learning Based System to Recommend Similar & Compatible PC Components**

</div>

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

The **PC Parts Recommender System** is a deep learning–powered tool that helps users:
- 🔍 Find **similar but cheaper** components (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, etc.)  
- 🤝 Get **compatible part recommendations** to build balanced, high-performance PC setups  

This project is developed by a team of students in 2 month as part of a practical ML/DL course .

| Name        | Role                              |
|------------|------------------------------------|
| 👨‍💻 **Dhahbi Mohamed** | Team Lead, Data Scientist(learner)|
| 👨‍💻 **Bouthayna Hamdi** |ML Enginner (learner)|
| 👩‍💻 **Sami Abdelhafidh** | UI/UX Designer, Back-end Devolleper|

**important_team_note:**|
  ⚠️ Even though each member has specific tasks, our main objective is that 
  everyone learns AI and understands every stage of the project. 

  🗓️ At the end of each week, we hold a team meeting to:
    - Review the progress in each area (scraping, cleaning, modeling, etc.)
    - Explain the work simply so everyone understands
    - Ensure all members can follow the full pipeline from start to finish

  💡 This transforms the project from divided work into a shared learning experience 
  for the whole team 🚀

  
> Tasks are managed using **Notion**, development happens in **Google Colab**, and version control with **GitHub**.
